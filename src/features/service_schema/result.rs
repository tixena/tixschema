//! The `<Operation>Result` type: the two arms an operation declared, joined into one return type.
//!
//! The envelope is all this adds. Whatever the operation named as its success type and as its
//! error type crosses unchanged — no field is added to either, none removed, none renamed — so a
//! message that happens to carry a key called `type` keeps it and one that does not never gains
//! one.
//!
//! The failure arm holds the declared error *or* a fault, rather than the union growing a third
//! member: two members sharing `ok: false` would stop `ok` being a discriminant at all, and
//! narrowing on the envelope would then tell a caller only that the call failed. Two arms, with the
//! fault behind the literal `isServiceFault: true`, leave the compiler something to narrow on at
//! both levels.
//!
//! A one-way operation gets no result type. It declared no reply and therefore no error, and a
//! type joining arms it does not have would be a type nothing can be assigned from.
//!
//! Both names carry the service: `UsageServiceGetBalanceResult`, and the fault it can hold is
//! `UsageServiceFault`. Two services declaring a `get_balance` each would otherwise publish one
//! `GetBalanceResult` twice into the one flat file a bundle is.
//!
//! A `body = "stream"` operation's own success is declared in Rust as `StreamedAnswer`, a type with
//! no `#[model_schema()]` of its own — the ordinary `value` rendering would publish that bare name
//! as a TypeScript reference nothing declares. [`stream_success_ts_type`] stands in for it instead,
//! mirroring the Rust and Dart clients' own streamed record.
