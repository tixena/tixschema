//! The TypeScript `ws_rpc` transport: a socket seam a platform `WebSocket` satisfies as it is, a
//! heartbeat, and a check of every reply against the operation's own declared schemas.
//!
//! # The seam is structural, not an adapter
//!
//! [`socket_type`] names four members every platform `WebSocket` already has (`send`, `close`,
//! `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` for `"message"` and `"close"`), so `new WebSocket(url)`
//! plugs into [`transport_factory`] with nothing written in between. Nothing generated here names
//! `WebSocket` itself.
//!
//! # One socket, one transport, one heartbeat
//!
//! The returned transport owns a per-socket request counter and a correlation map keyed by frame
//! id, exactly as [`super::client`]'s own AMQP-shaped transport is bound to reach an
//! application-supplied one; the difference here is that this transport also owns the liveness
//! probe, since nothing upstream of a raw socket does it for it. A `ping` goes out every
//! `heartbeat.intervalMs` (default 30 s), a `pong` re-arms the next one, and a socket that misses
//! one within `heartbeat.timeoutMs` (default 10 s) is closed through the seam's own `close()` —
//! which settles every request still waiting with a `transport-failure` fault, the same fault every
//! other close reaches for.
//!
//! # Every reply is checked before a caller sees it
//!
//! A generated client already validates what it is about to send; this transport is what validates
//! what comes back. [`schemas_table`] builds one lookup per direction from the service's
//! request-and-reply operations, keyed by the operation's own wire name, and the transport's
//! `checked` reader parses a success `value` or a declared `error` against it — a mismatch becomes
//! a `failed-validation` fault naming the first offending key, through [`issues_fault_fn`].
//!
//! # Gated with the schemas it reads
//!
//! Every table entry and every check reaches for a message's own `$Schema` const, so this module is
//! emitted only where [`crate::features::service_schema::seam`] is: a build with no Zod surface has
//! nothing to check a reply against.
