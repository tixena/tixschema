//! The TypeScript client: a factory over an injected transport, with one camelCase method per
//! operation, shaped so a call site reads exactly as the hand-written one it replaces.
//!
//! # What a call site sees
//!
//! ```typescript
//! const usage = createUsageServiceClient(transport);
//! const result = await usage.getBalance({ organizationId });
//! if (result.ok) {
//!   render(result.value.credits);
//! } else if ("isServiceFault" in result.error) {
//!   reportUnexpected(result.error.fault);
//! } else {
//!   switch (result.error.errorCode) { … }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Outbound validation comes before the transport, not after it
//!
//! Every method parses its message against the message's own generated schema first. A failure
//! answers with a fault **without reaching the transport**, naming the key that failed: the
//! operation never ran, so what came back is not one of the errors it declared, and a caller's
//! code is identical whether the fault came from here or from the far end.
//!
//! # Where the schemas come from, and why this module exists only beside them
//!
//! The schema a message validates against is the one `#[model_schema()]` publishes for it, which
//! only a build with the Zod surface on writes at all. This module is gated with it: a client whose
//! check was dropped would forward whatever it was handed while reading exactly like the checked
//! one, so a build that publishes no schema publishes no client either.
//!
//! # A one-way method has nowhere to return a fault
//!
//! A one-way operation's method answers `Promise<void>`, so a refused message cannot come back as
//! a value. It is thrown instead — the transport is still never reached, and a defect that would
//! otherwise vanish stays visible.
//!
//! What is thrown is part of the published surface rather than something to be discovered from the
//! emitted body, so it is named: `<Service>Refusal`, an `Error` carrying the fault on a `fault`
//! property. The method's own `JSDoc` names it too, `Promise<void>` having no room to say it.
