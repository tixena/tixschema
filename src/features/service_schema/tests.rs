//! What the service publishes to TypeScript, read off the strings themselves.
//!
//! The rendered TypeScript is asserted as text rather than as tokens, because text is what a bundle
//! writes to a `.ts` file and what a TypeScript compiler then reads.
//!
//! **What text assertions do and do not prove.** Nothing here type-checks the bundle. These tests
//! read structure: that a member is required rather than optional, that a name carries the
//! service, that the transport is named only on the far side of the validation check. They cannot
//! prove the emitted file compiles, and they cannot prove that an implementation missing a method
//! is rejected where it reaches the factory — only a compiler can, and one does: the type-check
//! group in `tests/service_schema_typescript_tests/type_check.rs` hands the bundle and two
//! implementations to a real `tsc` wherever one is reachable.
