//! The TypeScript a service implements: an interface it satisfies in full or does not compile, the
//! outcomes its operations answer with, and the factory that turns an implementation into a
//! dispatcher.
//!
//! # Why an interface and not a table of handlers
//!
//! This is the piece the whole construct exists for. An operation declared and implemented by
//! nobody is only prevented if the compiler refuses the incomplete implementation, so the emitted
//! interface has one required member per operation — no optional members, no index signature,
//! nothing a partial implementation slips through. Adding an operation breaks every implementation
//! of the service, which is the point.
//!
//! # An implementation cannot fabricate a fault
//!
//! An operation publishes two types, not one. `<Service><Operation>Result` is what a *caller*
//! reads: the value, the declared error, or a fault. `<Service><Operation>Outcome` is what an
//! *implementation* returns, and its failure arm is the declared error alone. A fault reports a
//! failure the operation never declared, and the two places entitled to build one are both
//! generated — this dispatcher and the client.
//!
//! # The dispatcher exists only beside a schema
//!
//! An arm parses the payload before it calls, which is what entitles an implementation to assume
//! its message is valid. The parse is against the `<Message>$Schema` const `#[model_schema()]`
//! publishes, so this module is gated with the Zod surface that writes one: a build without it
//! publishes no dispatcher rather than one that narrows an unread payload with `as` and hands it to
//! an implementation written against a guarantee nothing checked.
//!
//! # The context is explicit and generic
//!
//! The interface carries a context type parameter and every method takes it, mirroring the Rust
//! trait. The code owning the transport constructs one per message and hands it to the dispatcher.
//! It appears in no message and no schema.
