//! The TypeScript `ws_rpc` dispatcher attachment: reads every `notify` and `request` frame naming
//! a service off a socket, drives the generated dispatcher, and answers a request with a reply
//! frame.
//!
//! # A required `onFault`
//!
//! A `notify` frame that fails inside the dispatcher — an unknown operation, a payload that will
//! not become the operation's message — answers a framed fault with nobody waiting on a reply to
//! carry it. `onFault` is where that fault goes: passed once, at the attachment, rather than
//! reached for at every place a frame could be pushed.
//!
//! # A one-way operation reached as a request is still answered
//!
//! A caller that sent a `request` is left waiting until something replies, so a request naming a
//! one-way operation still gets one: `{ ok: true, value: null }` once the dispatcher's own promise
//! settles with `undefined`.
//!
//! # Gated with the dispatcher it drives
//!
//! `create{Service}Dispatcher` — and the `{Service}Impl` and `{Service}Fault` types this reaches
//! for — exist only where [`super::service`] and [`super::fault`] are, so this module is emitted
//! only there too. The socket type it attaches to is [`super::ws_client`]'s own, so a bundle names
//! `ts_ws_client()` before `ts_ws_service()`.
