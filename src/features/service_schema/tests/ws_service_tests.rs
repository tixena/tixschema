//! The `ws_rpc` dispatcher attachment, read off the emitted text.
//!
//! What these prove and what they cannot: the attachment's own signature, that it drives the
//! generated dispatcher rather than a service-specific switch, and that a refused `notify` and an
//! answered `request` go where the design says. No TypeScript toolchain is reachable here, so none
//! of them type-checks the bundle; `tests/service_schema_typescript_tests/type_check.rs` is what
//! proves a complete implementation compiles at the attachment and an incomplete one is refused.
