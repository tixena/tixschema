//! The TypeScript a `#[service_schema]` service publishes, behind one registration line.
//!
//! # Registration rides with the service
//!
//! In the consuming codebase a type reaches the emitted TypeScript only by being named by hand in
//! a bundle's entity list. A message the macro declared has nobody to write that line: the author
//! never wrote the type and has no reason to know its name, so a forgotten line would leave a
//! Rust-only message and a client unable to call the operation at all.
//!
//! So `ts_definition()` answers for the service *and* for every message
//! [`parse`](crate::service_schema::parse) recorded on
//! [`ServiceDef::generated_messages`](crate::service_schema::parse::ServiceDef::generated_messages)
//! — the same list the message emitter writes the types from, read rather
//! than re-derived, so what is written and what is registered cannot disagree. A service is added
//! to a bundle once and nothing it declared can be left behind.
//!
//! # Why the registration hangs off `<Service>Schema`
//!
//! The design spells the bundle line `UsageService::ts_definition()`, and Rust does not allow it:
//! `UsageService` is a trait, an inherent `impl` on a trait is not a thing, and calling a trait's
//! associated function without naming an implementing type is `error[E0790]`. A struct of the same
//! name would collide with the trait in the type namespace. So the artifacts hang off a unit struct
//! named for the service, `UsageServiceSchema`, and the bundle line reads
//! `UsageServiceSchema::ts_definition()` — still one line per artifact, still nothing to remember
//! per message.
//!
//! # What each artifact is
//!
//! - `ts_definition()`: every generated message's type and schema, the fault type and the kind it
//!   reports, and one [`result`] type per operation that answers.
//! - `ts_client()`: the AMQP-shaped transport seam, the client type and the factory that binds one.
//! - `ts_http_client()`: the `http_rest` transport seam — a plain-terms request in, response out,
//!   nothing here naming the library that finally carries the call — the client type, and the
//!   factory that binds one.
//! - `ts_service()`: the interface an implementation satisfies in full, the outcome types it
//!   answers with, and the dispatcher factory.
//!
//! # The client and the dispatcher exist only where the Zod surface does
//!
//! A message validates when it is constructed, in both directions: the client parses what it is
//! about to send before a transport is reached, and the dispatcher parses what arrived before an
//! implementation is entered, so an implementation may assume its message is valid. On the
//! TypeScript side both checks are the same parse, against the `<Message>$Schema` const
//! `#[model_schema()]` publishes — and only a build with the `zod` feature publishes one.
//!
//! So a build with `typescript` on and `zod` off emits neither. The two artifacts it can still
//! write truthfully — the message types and the result envelopes — are published exactly as they
//! always are, because they describe what a Rust service puts on the wire and that half validates
//! either way. The two it cannot are absent rather than emitted without their check: a client that
//! forwards whatever it is handed and a dispatcher that narrows an unread payload with `as` would
//! both compile, both look like the checked ones, and neither would hold the guarantee every
//! caller of them is written against.
//!
//! A bundle naming `<Service>Schema::ts_client()` in such a build is refused where it names it,
//! which is the one place the choice of features can still be acted on.
//!
//! # Every emitted name carries the service
//!
//! TypeScript has no per-service scope. Rust puts each service's supporting types in a module of
//! its own, and a bundle is one flat file — so a consuming codebase with ten services in one
//! bundle would declare `ServiceFault` ten times and would not compile, and two services sharing
//! an operation name would collide on the result type the same way. Every name emitted here is
//! therefore prefixed with the service: `UsageServiceFault`, `UsageServiceGetBalanceResult`,
//! `UsageServiceClient`. The prefix makes TypeScript say what Rust already means.
//!
//! # The fault's TypeScript is generated, not written
//!
//! The Rust `ServiceFault` carries `#[model_schema()]`, so its TypeScript comes from the same
//! declaration as the Rust type and the two cannot drift. Nothing here writes a fault's fields; the
//! registration below asks the Rust type for them, exactly as it does for every message.
//!
//! What the registration adds is the seal. The fields publish under a name of their own,
//! `<Service>FaultFields`, and [`fault`] declares `<Service>Fault` over them as those fields plus a
//! brand keyed on a symbol the bundle exports nowhere. Rust refuses a fabricated fault with `E0451`
//! on the fields, and this is what TypeScript can be given in its place: a type a caller reads
//! exactly as before and an implementation cannot write.
