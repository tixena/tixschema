//! The AMQP request-and-reply transport: three inert macros, `{service}_amqp_rpc_dispatcher!`,
//! `{service}_amqp_rpc_client!` and `{service}_amqp_rpc_server!`, and nothing compiled where the
//! service is declared.
//!
//! Three macros rather than one, because the halves of a service usually live in different crates:
//! a crate that calls the service can see the contract but has no business seeing the server's
//! backend, a server crate has no use for a client, and a crate that only wants `dispatch` — a
//! hand-rolled adapter, or a test with no broker in reach — has no business seeing `lapin`, `tokio`
//! or `futures` either. Each is invoked and placed by the half that wants it, none drags in
//! another, and a crate that wants more than one places more than one.
//!
//! # The server: what the dispatcher cannot grow into
//!
//! `{service}_amqp_rpc_server!` emits everything the dispatcher does, plus the pieces that turn a
//! real `lapin::Channel` delivery into a call on an implementation: `Context`, a `ReplyHandle` that
//! implements the dispatcher's own `Reply`, the wire framing a reply is built through, and
//! `serve_until`, the consumer loop itself. [`dispatcher_items`] is the one emitter both the
//! dispatcher and the server macro build `dispatch` from, so the two can never answer one message
//! two different ways.
//!
//! A crate that places the server macro is the one crate on the bus: it names `lapin`, `tokio` and
//! `futures` in its own manifest, beside `serde`, `serde_json` and `tracing`, because the items
//! below call all six.
//!
//! # The dispatcher: what one arm does, and in what order
//!
//! Deserialize the payload into the operation's message, run *that message's own* `validate()`,
//! call the implementation behind a panic guard, answer. The order is the point: **an
//! implementation may assume its incoming message is valid, because an invalid one never reaches
//! it.** A payload that will not deserialize, a message that fails validation, an operation name
//! nothing recognises and a handler that panicked are all faults, and a fault goes through the
//! reply handle like any other answer rather than becoming a return value the transport has to
//! interpret.
//!
//! A request-and-reply arm calls exactly one of `send` and `fault`. A one-way arm calls neither
//! once its implementation has been entered, so nothing about replying appears on a path that
//! never replies. Acknowledgement is the transport's, not the handle's — `dispatch` returns
//! nothing, so the adapter that called it still holds the delivery and acknowledges once dispatch
//! is done. That placement is why the panic guard exists rather than being an extra: a panic
//! unwinding out of `dispatch` never reaches the acknowledgement, and the bus this was measured
//! against has no `nack`, no dead-letter exchange, no message TTL and no timeout to settle the
//! delivery in its place.
//!
//! # The headers channel: `header_in` and `header_out` over the AMQP headers table
//!
//! `#[service_schema_op(http(...))]`'s `header_in`/`header_out` bindings are not HTTP-only: every
//! transport carries them over whatever header-shaped channel it has, and AMQP's is the message's
//! own basic-properties headers table. [`Transport::notify`](super::Transport) and `::request`
//! carry a `headers: Vec<(String, String)>` beside the payload for exactly this — one JSON-encoded
//! entry per `header_in` binding outbound, and `request`'s answer carries the reply's own headers
//! back the same way. `IncomingMessage` carries the request leg's headers alongside its payload,
//! and `Reply::send` carries the reply leg's headers alongside its value.
//!
//! An arm reads each `header_in` value off the incoming headers before calling the implementation
//! — a value that will not decode as the bound argument's declared type is refused the same way an
//! invalid payload is, naming the header rather than a payload field — and passes it as the extra
//! argument the operation declared beside its message. A `header_out`-bound success type is a
//! tuple; the arm sends the response alone as the value and writes every element after it into the
//! reply's headers, JSON-encoded. The client mirrors both directions: it encodes each `header_in`
//! argument into `headers` before the call, and decodes `request`'s returned headers back into the
//! tuple `header_out` declared. An operation naming no `http(...)` group carries an empty
//! `headers` list either way — the channel exists, but nothing reads or writes it.
//!
//! # The client
//!
//! One method per operation, returning the operation's success type or a call error that is either
//! the operation's own error or a fault — one the remote produced, one this client raised against
//! its own outgoing message, or one the transport reported about a call that never landed.
//!
//! ## Three outcomes, two arms
//!
//! A call succeeds, returns the error the operation declared, or produces a fault. `Result` has
//! two arms, so the failure arm carries `CallError<E>`. A Rust service cannot *produce* a fault —
//! its signature admits only its own error type — but a Rust client can *receive* one, because the
//! remote it called produced it.
//!
//! ## Outbound validation comes before the transport, not after it
//!
//! The client runs the outgoing message's own validator first. A failure returns
//! `Err(CallError::Fault(…))` naming the field **without touching the transport**: the operation
//! never ran, so it is not a declared error, and a caller's code is identical whether the fault
//! came from its own validator or from the far end.
//!
//! ## A transport that could not carry the call has somewhere to say so
//!
//! Both transport methods answer a `Result`, the failure arm carrying whatever the transport wants
//! to say in words. Without one, a transport that knows its reply is never coming — a deadline it
//! imposed, a connection that went away — can only panic or hang, and the caller is left holding a
//! call that never completes and no fault to report. The client turns that arm into
//! `ServiceFaultKind::TransportFailure`, so a caller reads a call that did not travel the same way
//! it reads every other defect. Whether a deadline exists at all, and how long it is, stays the
//! transport's: this is where the answer is reported, not where it is decided.
//!
//! ## Reading a fault back
//!
//! `ServiceFault` derives `Serialize` and deliberately not `Deserialize`, so a fault never arrives
//! simply by having been written on the wire. The client deserializes into a private mirror that
//! does derive it and mints the fault through the constructors the service's module publishes. The
//! mirror is the seam; the seal on the fault survives it.
//!
//! ## A client takes no context
//!
//! The trait's context exists for the thing that answers: a logger, and later whatever else an
//! implementation reaches for that has no business being in a message. A caller has no
//! implementation to hand one to, so a client method takes the operation's arguments and nothing
//! else — which is what the generated TypeScript client has always taken.
//!
//! # Why the tokens sit inside a macro
//!
//! Everything below is a stored token sequence in the crate that declares the service, and is
//! compiled only in the crate that invokes the macro. That is what keeps `serde_json` and
//! `tracing` out of the declaring crate's manifest, and what lets a service decline this shape
//! entirely: `IncomingMessage`'s operation-name-over-opaque-bytes routing is one transport model,
//! and a service that asks for no transport is emitted none of it.
//!
//! # Where each macro is placed, and why the placement is the consumer's problem
//!
//! Each macro emits bare items and opens no module of its own, so the caller names the module and
//! two transports in one crate cannot collide. Which module, though, is not free: what a
//! `macro_rules!` body expands to is linted under the *invoking* crate's levels, and three of the
//! lints a strict consumer denies are decided by where they put the invocation rather than by
//! anything emitted here.
//!
//! Each invocation goes in a module of its own **file**, and the `mod` declarations go above the
//! crate's `use` items:
//!
//! ```text
//! // src/lib.rs
//! mod amqp_client;
//! mod amqp_transport;
//!
//! use crate::contract::UsageService;
//! ```
//!
//! ```text
//! // src/amqp_transport.rs
//! declaring_crate::usage_service_amqp_rpc_dispatcher!();
//! ```
//!
//! ```text
//! // src/amqp_client.rs
//! use declaring_crate::{AvailableBalanceRequest, AvailableBalanceResponse};
//!
//! declaring_crate::usage_service_amqp_rpc_client!();
//! ```
//!
//! An inline `mod amqp_transport { … }` earns `clippy::inline_modules`; a `mod` written below a
//! `use` earns `clippy::arbitrary_source_item_ordering`; and reaching the author's own types
//! through `use declaring_crate::*;` earns `clippy::wildcard_imports`. The client module names
//! them one by one instead — the messages, the successes and the errors a method signature
//! spells, which the expansion writes exactly as the author wrote them.
//!
//! A consumer is free to publish either module: what they publish is documented, and nothing in
//! it publishes a field or answers a `Result` without saying under `# Errors` what the failure arm
//! holds.
//!
//! # The declaring crate invokes by bare name, never by path
//!
//! A crate that declares a service *and* places one of its halves reaches the macro by its bare
//! name in textual scope — `usage_service_amqp_rpc_dispatcher!();` below the declaration, with
//! `#[macro_use] mod contract;` carrying it out of a submodule. Both `crate::…!()` and
//! `use crate::…;` are refused there, a proc macro having been what defined the macro:
//!
//! ```text
//! error: macro-expanded `macro_export` macros from the current crate cannot be referred to by absolute paths
//!    = note: `#[deny(macro_expanded_macro_exports_accessed_by_absolute_paths)]` (part of `#[deny(future_incompatible)]`) on by default
//! ```
//!
//! Any other crate reaches either macro by path, as above.
//!
//! # Where a path inside the macro resolves
//!
//! Paths in a `macro_rules!` body resolve at the *invocation* site, so the two kinds are spelled
//! apart. Everything tixschema generated is reached through `$crate::` — the trait at the scope the
//! author declared it in, and the fault, the envelope, the message aliases and the per-operation
//! validators inside `$crate::{service}_schema` — which resolves in the crate that *defined* the
//! macro. Every runtime crate is reached through a leading `::` and resolves in the invoking crate,
//! which is therefore the one that names it: `::serde`, `::serde_json`, `::tracing`, `::core` and
//! `::std` for the dispatcher, `::serde`, `::serde_json` and `::core` for the client. The client
//! reaches no `::tracing` — nothing there catches a panic, so nothing there has anything to write
//! down, and a caller that only wants to make calls names one crate fewer than a crate that answers
//! them.
//!
//! What each macro writes itself is named bare: those items land in the module the caller supplied
//! and exist nowhere else. The dispatcher's are `IncomingMessage`, the `Reply` handle, the panic
//! guard and the reader that classifies a serde refusal; the client's are the `Transport` trait,
//! the fault mirror, the client type and the reader that turns one envelope into three outcomes.
//! The two sets do not overlap, so a crate that wants both can place them in one module.
//!
//! Four of those are emitted only where the service reaches them, `dead_code` being an error in
//! plenty of consumers' builds and unfixable from where they stand. The panic guard and the
//! refusal reader are an arm's, so a service declaring no operation is emitted neither, and its
//! `dispatch` binds neither an implementation nor a context. The fault mirror and the answer
//! reader read a reply, so a service declaring only one-way operations is emitted neither.
//!
//! Each macro's items are emitted types first, then `impl` blocks, then functions — the grouping
//! `clippy::arbitrary_source_item_ordering` asks for by default, which costs nothing to hold and
//! which a function emitted above a type would break for every consumer at once.
//!
//! A type the *author* wrote is the one thing spelled as they wrote it: `Vec<Slug>` and `String`
//! share no crate prefix that would be true of both. The module the client macro is invoked in
//! supplies them, exactly as the service's own module supplies them through its `use super::*` —
//! and a caller has them in scope regardless, having to build the messages it sends.
//!
//! `#[macro_export]` puts each macro at the declaring crate's root whatever module it was written
//! in, and `$crate` reads from that same root — so a service declared in a submodule is reached by
//! the names it hoists there. Two of them are the declaration's own and are checked where it is
//! written: the service's generated module, which everything below the dispatcher is reached
//! through, and the trait, which the dispatcher's `where` clause binds. `support::root_anchors`
//! resolves both at the declaration, so a crate that leaves either unreachable stops compiling
//! itself rather than breaking every crate that goes on to invoke a macro. The client adds no
//! class of its own: it builds each message the macro declared through that module's own
//! `{Operation}Message` alias, the same path the dispatcher reads one through, so the module is the
//! whole of what it reaches. A service declared at the crate root hoists nothing.

         bytes, for the same reason `Reply::send` is: a transport merges its own fields — a \
         correlation id, an error flag — into the object before serializing it, and neither is \
         reachable behind an encoded buffer. `headers` carries one JSON-encoded entry per \
         `header_in` binding a bound operation declared, and is empty for every other one — on \
         AMQP these ride the message's own basic-properties headers table, beside whatever the \
         transport merges in.\n\n\
         Both methods answer a `Result`. `Err` is for a call that did not travel — a deadline the \
         transport imposed, a connection that went away — and carries whatever the transport wants \
         to say about it in words; the client turns it into a fault of kind `transport-failure`. \
         Deadlines, retries and backpressure are the transport's own: this arm is where the answer \
         is reported, not where it is decided. `request`'s answer carries the reply's own headers \
