//! The one thing this module says in a build that has no `serde` feature: a service is refused,
//! and the refusal names the feature and what to add.
//!
//! Ungated on purpose, and the only part of `service_schema` that is. Everything else the construct
//! emits is gated on the feature, so the crate's other unit tests cannot speak for the build where
//! it is missing — which is precisely the build this decision exists for.

/// The refusal is asserted whole, because the message *is* the decision as a user meets it. Which
/// error a build earns was read off a standalone compile of the same declaration rather than off
/// this assertion — token matching is as blind to that as a `compile_fail` doctest is — and it was
/// the only error the file earned:
///
/// ```text
/// error: service_schema: a service needs tixschema's `serde` feature, and this build does not have it
///               without it the TypeScript a service publishes names Rust fields rather than the camelCase
///               and kebab-case keys its own dispatcher writes, so the two halves disagree about the wire
///               add `features = ["serde"]` to the tixschema dependency in Cargo.toml
///   --> tests/zz_probe.rs:15:11

///
/// error: could not compile `tixschema` (test "zz_probe") due to 1 previous error

/// That same file under `--features serde,typescript` compiles, so the refusal is the feature's
/// absence and nothing else about the program. The companion below is the token-level half of that
/// pair, and it runs in every combination that does carry the feature.
