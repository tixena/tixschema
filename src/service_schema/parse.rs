//! The shape a `#[service_schema]` trait is read into, and the only place it is read.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! `parse_service` turns a declared trait into a [`ServiceDef`]. Every emitter downstream —
//! messages, supporting types, the dispatcher, the Rust client, the TypeScript artifacts — reads
//! that value and re-reads the trait for nothing. Two consequences follow and both are the point:
//! a rule about what a service may say is written once, here, and the emitters can be built in
//! parallel without touching each other's files.
//!
//! What the representation answers, per operation:
//!
//! - **What it is called.** Three spellings of one declaration, all derived: the Rust ident as
//!   written, [`OperationDef::ts_name`] camelCased for TypeScript callers, and
//!   [`OperationDef::wire_name`] kebab-cased for the wire. Only the wire name is overridable, with
//!   `#[service_schema_op(message = "...")]`, because services already ship names nobody would
//!   derive.
//! - **What it receives.** One message, always. [`OperationInputs`] records which of the three
//!   ways it was declared: the argument that already is the message, the argument list a message
//!   is declared from, or nothing, which gets an empty message. Where the macro declares one,
//!   [`OperationDef::generated_message_ident`] is what it is called, derived here rather than at
//!   each emitter so the messages, the dispatcher and the client cannot disagree about the name.
//! - **What it answers with.** [`OperationOutcome::Reply`] carries the two declared arms, or
//!   [`OperationOutcome::OneWay`] says there is no reply to carry.
//! - **What it answers as HTTP.** [`OperationDef::http`] carries what
//!   `#[service_schema_op(http(...))]` declared — method, path, the status table, and the header
//!   bindings — or `None` for an operation that named no group, which defaults to `POST
//!   /{wire-name}`, status 200, the whole message as the body. A transport reads this one parsed
//!   shape and never re-parses the attribute.
//!
//! The context is on [`ServiceDef`], not on any operation: every operation takes it, it is the
//! same type for all of them, and it reaches no message and no schema.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! **Nothing about how a message is annotated** is here. Every ident and every type below is the
//! author's own, carried verbatim, so an emitter is free to write whatever derives and serde
//! attributes a generated message needs onto them.
