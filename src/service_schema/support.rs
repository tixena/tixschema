//! The two types an operation's outcome is carried in, emitted per service into the service's own
//! module: the fault a caller can receive but no implementation can answer with, and the client's
//! call-error enum.
//!
//! # Why they are generated rather than imported
//!
//! tixschema is a build-time macro crate and stays one. A service that had to depend on it at
//! runtime to name `ServiceFault` is exactly what was rejected when a marker type was proposed for
//! one-way operations, so each service gets its own copies in its own module. Two services in one
//! crate therefore carry two unrelated `ServiceFault` types, and a transport serving both answers
//! with both — that is the cost of the crate staying build-time only, and it is the cost the
//! design accepted.
//!
//! # The seal on `ServiceFault`
//!
//! The fault reports a failure the operation never declared, so no implementation answers with one:
//! an operation's signature admits only its own error type. The fields stay private, so a literal
//! written by hand is refused with `E0451` and the constructors are the only way one comes into
//! being.
//!
//! Those constructors are public. A fault is what a *dispatcher* answers a defect with, and a
//! dispatcher is not always the one emitted here — a hand-written one works against the contract
//! surface alone, and it can do nothing with a defect it has no way to report.
//!
//! `Deserialize` is deliberately not derived on the fault, so a fault never arrives simply by
//! having been written on the wire. `Serialize` is derived, because the transport has to put one
//! there. Reading one back off it is the generated client's business, and it happens through a
//! mirror that derives what the fault does not and then mints the fault through the constructors
//! published here.
//!
//! # What a dispatcher or a client expanded elsewhere reads from here
//!
//! The `Answered` envelope one writes and the other reads, the readers that turn a violation report
//! into the field and the detail a fault carries, and — one of each per operation — the name its
//! message is reached under and the validator that message runs. Both halves of a service are held
//! as macro tokens and expanded in crates that are usually not this one, so everything either of
//! them reaches is published for the same reason the fault's constructors are.
//!
//! An operation's message is republished here under `{Operation}Message` so that either half names
//! one path for every spelling: an author's own type, a type the macro declared, a type written
//! under a module of its own. It also gives two services in one crate room to receive same-named
//! messages, each module being its own namespace where the crate root is not.
//!
//! The validators are here because the fallback they run behind is: `MessageValidation` is shut in
//! a module of its own so that two blanket `validate()` methods are never in scope at once, and an
//! import written inside a transport's `macro_rules!` body is reported unused wherever the message
//! published an inherent `validate()` of its own. One per operation rather than one generic
//! function, because an inherent method only wins at a concrete type.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! The `Reply` handle. Its shape is one transport model's — one reply per message, answered with a
//! value or a defect — so it travels inside a transport's own macro, and a service that asks for no
//! transport is emitted none of it.

/// The service's own module, holding everything either half of a service reads and nothing that

///
/// # A service is declared at module scope, never inside a function body
///
/// The module opens with `use super::*;`, which is how the message aliases and the validators
/// behind them reach the trait and the message types the author declared beside it. A module
/// written inside a function body has the enclosing *module* as its parent rather than the
/// function, so `super` from there reaches past every name that function declared and finds none
/// of them. `#[model_schema]` carries the same requirement, for the same reason and through the
/// same import.
///
/// The macro cannot refuse the placement. An attribute macro is handed the annotated item's own
/// tokens and nothing about the scope it was written in, and a trait written inside a function is
/// the same tokens as one written beside it — so there is no signal to read and nothing to refuse
/// on. What a function-scoped declaration earns instead is the compiler's own resolution errors:
/// one for the trait, and one for each type an operation named.
///
/// The consequence worth knowing is that rustdoc wraps a doctest with no explicit `fn main` in one,
/// so a doctest declaring a service writes `fn main() {}` of its own. The pair below is exactly
/// that difference and nothing else. At module scope it compiles:
///
/// ```rust
/// use tixschema::service_schema;
///

/// pub struct BalanceRequest;
///
/// #[derive(serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]

///     ) -> Result<BalanceResponse, BalanceError>;
/// }
///
/// fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// The run below is that one with `fn main() {}` taken off the end, which puts the whole
/// declaration inside the `fn main` rustdoc writes around it. Nothing else differs:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
