//! The messages an operation did not name: `<Operation>Request` for the argument-list and
//! zero-argument shapes, emitted like any other type with its TypeScript, Zod and JSON Schema.
//!
//! Reads the [`GeneratedMessage`] list [`parse`](super::parse) recorded off
//! [`OperationInputs`](super::parse::OperationInputs), and never re-reads the trait — so what gets
//! written here and what gets registered downstream are one list, and neither can name a type the
//! other does not.
//!
//! Each message is annotated exactly as a hand-written one is, and for the same reasons. It
//! carries `#[model_schema()]`, so a client on the far side gets its TypeScript type, its Zod
//! schema and its JSON Schema rather than a Rust-only type it cannot construct. It carries the
//! serde derives and `rename_all = "camelCase"` itself, because the author never wrote the type
//! and has nowhere to put either: an argument is `snake_case` in Rust and camelCase on the wire,
//! exactly as a hand-written field is.

/// A generated message publishes under the operation's own name, with no service prefix.

/// That is deliberate — it is the name a caller in either language types — and it means two
/// services in one module cannot both leave the same operation name's message to the macro. The
/// second declaration is a duplicate definition in Rust, so a bundle carrying two same-named
/// generated messages cannot be built at all. The result types either service publishes *are*
/// prefixed, because those the macro names itself and TypeScript has no per-service scope.
///
/// Two services whose generated messages differ compile:
///
/// ```rust
/// use tixschema::service_schema;
///
/// #[derive(serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// pub struct Report;
///
/// #[derive(serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// pub enum Failed {
///     DbError,
/// }
///
/// #[service_schema()]
/// pub trait AlphaService<Ctx> {
///     async fn sweep(&self, ctx: &Ctx) -> Result<Report, Failed>;
/// }
///
/// #[service_schema()]
/// pub trait BetaService<Ctx> {
///     async fn reconcile(&self, ctx: &Ctx) -> Result<Report, Failed>;
/// }
///
/// fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// The run below is that one with `reconcile` spelled `sweep`, and nothing else changed, so the
/// refusal can only be the message name the two now share:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// use tixschema::service_schema;
///
/// #[derive(serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// pub struct Report;
///
/// #[derive(serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
/// pub enum Failed {
///     DbError,
/// }
///
/// #[service_schema()]
/// pub trait AlphaService<Ctx> {
///     async fn sweep(&self, ctx: &Ctx) -> Result<Report, Failed>;
/// }
///
/// #[service_schema()]
/// pub trait BetaService<Ctx> {
///     async fn sweep(&self, ctx: &Ctx) -> Result<Report, Failed>;
/// }
///
/// fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// `compile_fail` says only that *something* was refused and this toolchain checks no error code a
/// doctest names, so the pair above was compiled standalone and read. The refusal is a pile rather
/// than one sentence — eleven errors, the first two naming the message and the module beside it,
/// the rest following from them — and none of them names the operation or the two services:
///
/// ```text
/// error[E0428]: the name `sweep_request_schema` is defined multiple times
/// error[E0428]: the name `SweepRequest` is defined multiple times
/// error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `Deserialize<'_>` for type `SweepRequest`
/// error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `Serialize` for type `SweepRequest`
/// error[E0592]: duplicate definitions with name `json_schema`
/// error[E0592]: duplicate definitions with name `ts_definition`
/// error[E0592]: duplicate definitions with name `zod_schema`
/// error[E0034]: multiple applicable items in scope        (×4)
/// error: could not compile `tixschema` (test "zz_probe") due to 11 previous errors
/// ```
