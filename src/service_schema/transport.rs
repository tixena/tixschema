//! The transports a service can ask for, and the one place a name is bound to one.
//!
//! `#[service_schema(transports = ["amqp_rpc"])]` is where a service says which of them it wants.
//! [`parse_transports`] reads that list, and [`Transport`] is the vocabulary it reads against —
//! written with an underscore rather than a hyphen, because a transport's name reaches a generated
//! macro name and a hyphen cannot.
//!
//! # Adding one
//!
//! A module beside [`amqp_rpc`], and one variant here. The variant makes the match in [`emit`]
//! incomplete until the new one is answered for, so the emitter each transport contributes is bound
//! in this file and nowhere else, and no existing transport's module is touched to add another.
//!
//! # What a named transport contributes
//!
//! Three `#[macro_export] macro_rules!` per transport the service asked for, named
//! `{service}_{transport}_dispatcher`, `{service}_{transport}_client` and
//! `{service}_{transport}_server`, and emitted at the trait's own scope. Nothing inside any of them
//! is compiled where the service is declared, and a service that named no transport is emitted
//! nothing here at all.
//!
//! Three macros rather than one, because the halves of a service usually live in different crates —
//! a crate that calls the service can see the contract but has no business seeing the server's
//! backend, and a crate that only wants `dispatch` itself (a hand-rolled adapter, or a test with no
//! broker in reach) has no business seeing the server macro's `lapin`, `tokio` and `futures`
//! either. Each is invoked and placed by the half that wants it, and none drags in another.
//!
//! [`emit`] walks [`Transport::KNOWN`] rather than the list as written, so a transport named twice
//! contributes one pair rather than two definitions of one exported name.
