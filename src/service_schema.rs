//! `#[service_schema]`: a service declared once as a trait, read once, and handed to the emitters.
//!
//! [`parse`] reads and validates the declared trait into a
//! [`ServiceDef`](parse::ServiceDef) — the representation everything below consumes and nothing
//! below re-derives. The trait itself is emitted here, as declared save for the `async fn`
//! desugaring the compiler asks for; every other artifact belongs to one of the emitter modules,
//! each of which is landed by its own task.
//!
//! # The construct exists only where the `serde` feature does
//!
//! Everything a service emits leans on serde the crate unconditionally — every declared message
//! and both fault types derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize`, and the dispatcher reads its payload
//! through `serde_json`. What tixschema's own `serde` feature decides is whether the *describing*
//! surfaces read serde attributes, and the macro writes those attributes itself: `camelCase` onto
//! every message it declares, `kebab-case` onto the fault kind. Without the feature a service puts
//! those keys on the wire and publishes TypeScript naming the Rust idents instead — two halves of
//! one service disagreeing about the wire between them, and nothing failing to compile.
//!
//! So the feature's absence is a build failure rather than a silent lie, and the emitters below
//! are gated on it: in a build without it there is no dispatcher, no client and no supporting type
//! to emit, and [`serde_feature_refusal`] `parse`
//! is the whole of what a declaration produces. `parse` is gated with them: how a service is
//! *written* only matters where one can exist, and nothing in that reading is feature-dependent
//! anyway — the refusals it produces are read by its own unit tests, in every build that has the
//! feature.
//!
//! # What a crate declaring a service names in its own manifest
//!
//! One runtime crate, because the generated code calls it: `serde`. Every declared message and
//! both fault types derive what serde writes, and with both halves of a service held as tokens
//! nothing else at the trait's own scope reaches a runtime crate at all. tixschema itself is
//! build-time only and serde is not reached through it — a service names it the way it names any
//! dependency of code it compiles.
//!
//! `serde_json` and `tracing` are named by the crate that *invokes* a transport's macro rather than
//! by the one that declares the service, because that is where the code calling them is compiled —
//! and that crate names `serde` again, for what a transport's own items derive and bind. A
//! dispatcher reads its payload through `serde_json` and writes a caught panic down through
//! `tracing`. A caught panic is written down for the same reason it is caught: a dispatcher catches
//! a panicking handler in order to return so the transport can settle the delivery, and catching
//! without recording would trade a stalled consumer for a silent one.
//!
//! It costs a consumer that wants no logging very little. With no subscriber installed the
//! callsite registers against `NoSubscriber`, whose `register_callsite` answers `Interest::never()`
//! and whose `enabled` answers `false`, so the event is never built. The crate itself pulls in
//! `tracing-core` (and its `once_cell`), `pin-project-lite`, and the `tracing-attributes` proc
//! macro, which brings the same `proc-macro2`/`quote`/`syn` tixschema already builds against —
//! nothing more. The machinery that formats and writes records lives in `tracing-subscriber`,
//! which is not named here and which only a service that wants output adds.
//!
//! A crate that invokes a dispatcher macro and forgets `tracing` earns one error naming the crate:
//! `error[E0433]: cannot find `tracing` in the crate root`. Forgetting `serde_json` earns seven.
//!
//! A crate that only *places a client* — a transport's client macro, invoked where a caller wants
//! one — names one of the two. The client serializes what it sends and reads what comes back
//! through `serde` and `serde_json`; it catches no panic, so it has nothing to write down and
//! reaches no `tracing`.
//!
//! **`#[model_schema]` requires none of this.** Only an invoked dispatcher macro reaches a logger,
//! so a crate that describes types and declares no service names neither `serde_json` nor
//! `tracing`.
