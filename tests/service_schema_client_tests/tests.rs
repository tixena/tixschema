//! The transports the generated client is driven over, and everything read off it.
//!
//! The service and its messages are declared here; the modules the client and the dispatcher were
//! each expanded into sit beside this file, at the crate root the macros' `$crate` resolves to.
//!
//! `ProbeTransport` hands out prepared answers and writes down what it was asked to send, which is
//! how a test reads the operation name travelling beside the payload rather than inside it. Built
//! with no answers it panics the moment either method is reached, which is how the
//! outbound-validation tests prove the transport was never touched.
//!
//! `Loopback` sends the message straight into the generated dispatcher and hands back what the
//! reply handle captured. It is the only place both halves of the seam meet, and it is where the
//! envelope one writes and the other reads is proven to be one envelope.
//!
//! `DeadlineTransport` is the bus this design has to live on when a reply does not come: it records
//! the call, waits out a deadline it imposed itself, and reports that nothing landed. It is the
//! only transport here that answers in the failure arm, and it is what the fault a caller reads
//! for a call that never completed is measured against.
