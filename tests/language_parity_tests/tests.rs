//! One declaration, two validators, one sentence.
//!
//! Everything here compares the two things `#[model_schema()]` emits for the same bound against
//! each other: the report the generated Rust validator answers with, and the report the generated
//! Zod schema would answer with. Nothing asserts that the Rust text merely *changed* — a test that
//! reads only one language cannot see the two drift apart, which is how they drifted in the first
//! place.
//!
//! **How the Zod half is read.** No zod runs here, so what it would say is read off the schema the
//! macro published: the `{ error: … }` argument written for each check, rendered the way zod
//! renders one. That leaves exactly the two holes the emitter can write — the length of the value
//! and the value itself — and filling them is [`zod_sentence`]. The strings the tests assert are
//! the ones zod 4 actually produced for these schemas.
//!
//! **What the dispatcher adds.** Neither sentence names its field. The Rust validator writes
//! `'{field}': ` in front of its own, and the generated TypeScript dispatcher writes
//! `'${issue.path.join(".")}': ` in front of zod's, so the two lines agree once the same path is
//! written in front of both. Each comparison below writes that path itself, from the key the
//! payload spells.
