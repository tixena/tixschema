//! One service covering every input shape and both outcomes, dispatched over payloads that take
//! every path through an arm: the answer, the operation's own error, an undeserializable payload,
//! a name nothing answers to, a handler that panicked, and a one-way operation that settles
//! without publishing.
//!
//! The probe reply handle records which of `send` and `fault` was called, so a test can assert not
//! only what was answered but that a request-and-reply arm answered exactly once and that a
//! one-way arm that reached its implementation answered nothing at all.

/// A message annotated with `#[model_schema_prop]`, and where a violation of it is caught.
///
/// Gated because the annotation is: the constraint is read, and the validator that enforces it
/// written, only when `serde` is on beside a surface that reads the constraint.
///
/// **The two answers a payload can earn here are different answers, and the arm gives whichever
/// one is true.** Bytes that are not a document at all never become anything, and the fault says
/// the sender's serialization is broken. Everything that *does* read as a document and is then
/// turned away — a field carrying the wrong type of value, a key that is missing, a value a
/// constraint refuses — is a value someone supplied that the message does not admit, and the fault
/// says that instead and names the field wherever the refusal named one.
///
/// A receiver acts differently on each, and the line between them is `serde_json`'s own
/// classification of its refusal rather than the shape of the sentence it wrote. It is also where
/// the TypeScript service serving the same operation draws it: its reader parses the payload and
/// its schema then judges what was read, so a type mismatch and a broken bound are one kind there
/// and are one kind here. Constraints stay enforced by the validator alone and never as the
/// payload is read, which is what lets a broken bound name its field at all.
