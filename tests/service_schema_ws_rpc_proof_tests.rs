//! Joins the generated `ws_rpc` client and dispatcher for `DocumentSession`, and the generated
//! `ws_rpc` client and dispatcher for `SessionEvents`, through one in-memory `Wire` — no socket —
//! proving the two halves answer each other in both directions: a client's call answered by a
//! dispatcher, a header round trip, and a server's own client pushing an event a dispatcher on the
//! other side delivers.
//!
//! Gated on the `serde` feature, which `#[service_schema]` requires: a build without it is
//! refused at the declaration, so a harness declaring a service would not compile at all.
//!
//! The `use` at the foot is what `$crate` reaches inside every macro this crate expands: each
//! service's own module, and the trait its dispatcher and client bind.
