//! The server macro `#[service_schema]` generates for the `amqp_rpc` transport, compiled for real:
//! a service, its own `serve_until` named at a concrete type, the loop it runs driven with no
//! broker, and the wire framing a reply is built through.
//!
//! Gated on the `serde` feature, which `#[service_schema]` requires: a build without it is refused
//! at the declaration, so a harness declaring a service would not compile at all.
//!
//! # Why the placements below are shaped the way they are
//!
//! A `macro_rules!` body is linted under the levels of the crate that *invokes* it, so this file is
//! a consumer of the server macro as much as a test of it. The same four properties that keep the
//! dispatcher harness clean apply here:
//!
//! 1. every module is `#[path]`-attributed and lives in a file of its own, never `mod x { … }`,
//!    which is what `clippy::inline_modules` refuses;
//! 2. the `mod` declarations sit above the `use` items, which is the grouping
//!    `clippy::arbitrary_source_item_ordering` asks for;
//! 3. everything is private, so no generated item is *exported* — a `pub` module here would
//!    publish the proc macro's own message and support types along with it;
//! 4. the tests dispatch a message through the emitted `dispatch`, drive `serve_deliveries`, and
//!    name `serve_until` at a concrete type, so nothing the macro emits is dead. A real
//!    `lapin::Channel` cannot be built without a connection, so `serve_until` itself is named
//!    rather than run, and the loop it runs is driven through `serve_deliveries` instead.
