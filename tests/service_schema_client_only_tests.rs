//! A crate that places a client and no dispatcher, which is the half a caller of a service wants.
//!
//! The two halves a transport contributes are separate macros because they usually live in
//! separate crates: a crate that calls the service can see the contract but has no business seeing
//! the server's backend. That this binary compiles at all is the assertion — nothing here names
//! `dispatch`, `IncomingMessage` or `Reply`, and nothing here reaches `tracing` — and the calls
//! beneath it are what says the half that was placed works without the one that was not.
//!
//! Gated on the `serde` feature, which `#[service_schema]` requires: a build without it is refused
//! at the declaration, so a harness declaring a service would not compile at all.
